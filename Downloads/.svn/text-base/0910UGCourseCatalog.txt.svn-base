1.4 HOW TO SEARCH COURSES ON THE 
WEB 
• The first step is getting to the Course Catalog online, which is 
available on the University’s home page at www.uregina.ca. The 
Course Catalog link is on the UR Self-Service page, which can 
be accessed by either using the Quicklinks, other menu tags, or 
by searching Course Catalog using the search function. The 
Course Catalog can be found at 
https://banner.uregina.ca/prod/sct/bwckctlg.p_disp_dyn_ctlg. 
• Click on “Academic Calendar”. “Academic Calendars & Course 
Catalog” will appear.  Under the heading “Course Catalog”, click 
on ‘UR Self-Service” and the “Catalog Term” will appear. The 
catalog term you choose will give you information relevant to that 
term. You should look at the Term in which you are planning to 
register.   
• Once the term has been selected, click on Submit. This will take 
you to the Search function. The Subject is the only required field 
that must be entered. By clicking on one subject, and then, while 
holding the shift button, on another subject above or below, you 
can select several subjects at once. Note:  You must search by 
“Subject” (see table above). The output will be the courses that 
have the selected subject code(s). 
• You may wish to submit a Course Number Range.   
• If you enter a number into the “from” box, then only that 
course will be outputted.   
• If you enter a number in the “from” box AND the” to” box, 
both courses, and all courses in between, will be outputted.   
Note: All output will be in alphabetical order by Subject Code and 
then by Course Number. 
• You may also search by “Title”. You do not have to enter the full 
title.  
• If you search for a word, it will give you ALL titles that 
contain that word.   
Note: The search is case sensitive. If you search for MaTH, no 
courses will be retrieved.   
• You may search by “Level”. If you enter a “Subject”, and then 
choose “Level Undergrad”, all undergrad courses for the subject 
will display.   
• Lastly, you may search by “Credit range”, that is the number of 
credits you are looking for, for each course. 
• Once your search criteria is placed, select “Get Courses” to 
retrieve the result. 
1.5 FORMAT OF ONLINE COURSE CATALOG 
The online format is slightly different. 
Appearing will be the “Subject Code”, “Number”, and a dash with the 
“Full Course Title”. 
Below that will be the “Course Description”, which is the same 
description as the printed Course Catalog. This is the location where 
you will see the description, prerequisites, corequisites, approvals, 
and any special notes. 
After the description will be the “Hours”. The “Credit”, “Lecture”, “Lab”, 
and “Other hours” will be clearly labelled. 
 
University of Regina – 2009-2010 Undergraduate Course Catalog 
Page 3 
Following will be the “Level” of the course, the possible “schedule 
types”, and the “Faculty” and “Department” to which the course 
belongs. 
The final information on this page is “Course Attributes”. Please ignore 
this information. It is to be used for future reference and may not 
currently be held true. 
Note:  You can click on anything that is underlined. 
• You can click on the title which will take you to basically the 
same page, but shows Registration Restrictions placed on the 
course.   
Note: It is the restriction that is on at the Section level that affects 
registration (which in most cases is different from that of 
Catalog). 
• A schedule type that is underlined means there are sections 
scheduled for this course during the semester that you choose 
as the Catalog Term. If you click on one, you will get a list of the 
CRNs and the information about the sections for that specific 
course. 
The Self Service Class Schedule works the same and is located in the 
same area.  The only difference is there are more search options and 
there is more information that relates directly to the section. When 
searching the Class Schedule, you can get to the course’s Catalog 
record (to check out the description, prerequisites, co-requisites, 
approvals needed, notes, etc.) by clicking on the View Catalog Entry 
link.
